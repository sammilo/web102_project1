# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Publishing to GitHub

To add this project to GitHub from PowerShell, run the commands below (replace <your-repo-url> with the SSH or HTTPS URL of the repository you create on GitHub):

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# create a repository on GitHub (via website) and then add it as remote, for example:
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you have the GitHub CLI installed you can create the repo and push in one step:

```powershell
gh repo create my-repo --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

Notes:
- If you use HTTPS remote you will be asked for credentials the first time you push (or use a personal access token).
- Make sure `.gitignore` contains `node_modules/` and build output so you don't push large or generated files.
